SYNOPSIS
     ln source_file [target_file]
     ln source_file ... target_dir

DESCRIPTION
     The ln utility creates a new directory entry (linked file)	for the	file
     name specified by target_file.  The target_file will be created with the
     same file modes as	the source_file.  It is	useful for maintaining multi\-
     ple copies	of a file in many places at once without using up storage for
     the ``copies''; instead, a	link ``points''	to the original	copy.  There
     are two types of links; hard links	and symbolic links.  How a link
     ``points''	to a file is one of the	differences between a hard and sym\-
     bolic link.
