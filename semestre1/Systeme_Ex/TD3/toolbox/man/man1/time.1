DESCRIPTION
     The time utility executes and times the specified utility.	 After the

     the total time elapsed, the time used to execute the utility process and
     the time consumed by system overhead.

.P
EXIT STATUS
     If	utility	could be timed successfully, its exit status is	returned.  If
     utility terminated	abnormally, a warning message is output	to stderr.  If
     the utility was found but could not be run, the exit status is 126.  If
     no	utility	could be found at all, the exit	status is 127.	If time
     encounters	any other error, the exit status is between 1 and 125
     included.
