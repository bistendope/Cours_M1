<h1>Alice in Wonderland</h1>
<h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>
<p style="width:30%">
  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting</br>
  by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing</br>
  to do: once or twice she had peeped into</br>
  the book her sister was reading, but it had </br>
  no pictures or conversations in it, </br>
  &quot;and what is the use of a book,&quot; thought  Alice, &quot;without pictures or conversations?&quot; 
</p>
<p style="width:30%">
  So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
