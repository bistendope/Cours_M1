.P
DESCRIPTION
     In	its first form,	the mv utility renames the file	named by the source
     operand to	the destination	path named by the target operand.  This	form
     is	assumed	when the last operand does not name an already existing	direc\-
     tory.

.P
     In	its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a
     destination file in the existing directory	named by the directory oper\-
     and.  The destination path	for each operand is the	pathname produced by
     the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname
     component of the named file.

.P
EXIT STATUS
     The mv utility exits 0 on success,	and >0 if an error occurs.
