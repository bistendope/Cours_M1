.TH "NAME" 1 "" "     cat -- concatenate	and print files"

.P
SYNOPSIS
     cat file (\&...)

.P
DESCRIPTION
     The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output.  The file operands	are processed in command\-line order.  If file
     is	a single dash (`\-') or absent, cat reads from the standard input.  If
     file is a UNIX domain socket, cat connects	to it and then reads it	until
     EOF.  This	complements the	UNIX domain binding capability available in
     inetd(8).

.P
EXIT STATUS
     The cat utility exits 0 on	success, and >0	if an error occurs.
