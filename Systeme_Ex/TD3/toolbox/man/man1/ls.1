     ls	file (\&...)

.P
DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file	of a type other	than directory,	ls
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
     of	files contained	within that directory, as well as any requested, asso\-
     ciated information.

.P
     If	no operands are	given, the contents of the current directory are dis\-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non\-directory operands	are
     displayed first; directory	and non\-directory operands are sorted sepa\-
     rately and	in lexicographical order.

.P
EXIT STATUS
     The ls utility exits 0 on success,	and >0 if an error occurs.
